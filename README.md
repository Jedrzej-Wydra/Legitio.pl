## What is this product?
Legitio is an advanced AI-powered legal assistant available 24/7, offering fast and confidential advice in the field of civil law. Developed by Polish experts in law, mathematics, software engineering, and AI, Legitio analyzes user queries in real-time, providing precise answers based on current legal regulations. This innovative tool allows users to access legal help quickly without the need to schedule appointments with a lawyer.

## History
Working on Legitio was an incredible adventure where I could fully merge my legal, mathematical, and programming expertise. The question isn’t whether AI will replace lawyers—it likely won’t—but whether it can provide legal advice as good as (or even better than) human experts? The answer is: soon.

Legitio continues to evolve, aiming to cover the entirety of Polish law shortly, with plans to expand to the legal systems of other countries in the near future. Being part of this journey has been both a professional milestone and a fascinating experience, showcasing how technology can revolutionize the legal field.
